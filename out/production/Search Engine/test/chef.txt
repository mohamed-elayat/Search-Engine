hree days after Christmas, in a part of northeast Nashville that many locals describe as “dicey,” a Ford Explorer crashed through the front of a discount-tobacco shop at one end of a strip mall. Police later called the incident an attempted burglary. The vehicle, which had been reported stolen, was propelled by a brick weighting the accelerator. The store was empty—it was four-thirty in the morning. The authorities arrived to find the Ford abandoned and the shop on fire.

Two doors down, just past Jennifer Nails, Tyreese Lawless had come to work early, as usual, to clean the fryers at Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack. After hearing a boom, he got out of there, in case the flames reached the restaurant. Lawless began calling colleagues—to them, and to generations of customers, Prince’s is a kind of second home. Firefighters went inside and started yanking down ceiling tiles and singed insulation. Ducts and wiring lay exposed, and there was extensive damage from smoke and water. As a precaution, the fire department shut off the strip mall’s gas and electricity. Yellow police tape outside Prince’s front door stretched toward the shattered glass of the targeted bodega.

When Nashville residents learned that Prince’s would be closed indefinitely, a minor panic ensued. In the past decade or so, the restaurant’s signature dish, hot chicken, has proliferated worldwide, and the original incarnation, fried chicken bathed in fiery spices, has been subjected to relentless permutation—tacos, ramen, sushi, oysters, apple fritters, empanadas, pâté, poutine. The invention, now known everywhere as Nashville hot chicken, sounds like a viral novelty, like the cronut, but it long predates Instagram: it became popular more than eighty years ago, in the city’s black community, and the recipe originated with one family, the Princes. After the fire, @ThuggBugg_ tweeted, “Literally any other hot chicken place coulda burned down but it had to be prince’s.” Addressing the driver of the Ford Explorer, @OcifferJJ declared, “All of Nashville hates you sir.”

In November, Eater named Prince’s one of the thirty-eight essential places to dine in America. Six years ago, the James Beard Foundation gave the restaurant its America’s Classics award, which honors “timeless” establishments serving “quality food that reflects the character of its community.” Nashville hot chicken, the foundation said, was a “totemic” creation. The proprietors of Prince’s, and its many imitators, regularly appear on TV food-and-travel shows. Anthony Bourdain, after sampling the hot chicken of a competitor, Bolton’s, said, “I eat many strange and spicy things around the world, but never in my life have I experienced something like this.” He added, “Is it food? Or an initiation ritual for Yankees?”

Such comments can make eating Nashville hot chicken sound like one of those “challenges” in which people choke down spoonfuls of cinnamon. But for many diners the dish is an obsession. In a short documentary for the Southern Foodways Alliance, a Prince’s devotee describes hot chicken as “worse than dope” in its addictiveness. When Isaac Beard, who owned a massage-therapy clinic in Nashville, first ate Prince’s hot chicken, he thought that it was just O.K.; then, about a month later, he woke up in the middle of the night with an enormous craving. “From that moment on, I was licked,” he later told Timothy Charles Davis, the author of “The Hot Chicken Cookbook,” adding, “There’s something legitimate there in hot chicken that’s not there with, say, Buffalo wings.” (Beard now owns a hot-chicken restaurant, Pepperfire, four miles south of Prince’s.)

On Fridays and Saturdays, Prince’s stays open until 4 a.m., and in those early hours graveyard-shift workers share vintage wooden booths with country-music artists and fans emerging from the honky-tonks. A Prince’s employee once said that Beyoncé and Jay-Z always “send somebody down” for takeout when they’re in Nashville. Devotees from out of town are known to head to Prince’s straight from the airport. In the Reddit thread FoodPorn, someone once reported that a friend “flew from Nashville with Prince’s Hot Chicken in hand like she was carrying a donor organ.”

Ira Kaplan, of the indie band Yo La Tengo, heard about Prince’s from Richard Baluyut, of the band Versus. Kaplan has recalled, “We were told it came in ‘mild,’ ‘medium,’ ‘hot,’ and ‘extra-hot,’ but if we’d never been there before we would not be allowed to have extra-hot. We asked if we could at least taste ‘extra-hot sauce.’ What rubes we were—we were informed that there is no sauce.” Kaplan found Prince’s hot chicken “simultaneously delicious and practically inedible.” He ate it four days in a row. The band wrote a song about it, “Flying Lesson (Hot Chicken #1),” and then another, “Don’t Say a Word (Hot Chicken #2),” and then another, “Return to Hot Chicken.”

The weekend of the Ford Explorer crash, Prince’s had been expected to be even busier than usual: the Tennessee Titans were at home, playing the Indianapolis Colts, and the Predators, Nashville’s popular hockey team, were also in town. One vehicle after another pulled into the empty parking lot and idled, the occupants confounded by the “closed” sign.

The day after the crash, the woman who has been called the “queen mother” of Nashville hot chicken, André Prince Jeffries, drove to Prince’s and parked in her usual spot, four feet from the front door. Jeffries, who is in her early seventies, has run the restaurant since 1980. She wears glamorous hair styles, plum-colored lipstick, a smoky eye, and long lacquered nails. (That day’s shade was lavender.) She also had on gray sweatpants, a matching shawl, Ugg-style boots, and a red-and-purple crocheted cap. Enormous earrings dangled halfway to her chin. When she knows she’ll be interviewed on camera, she may dress in a Prince’s T-shirt; otherwise, she does not advertise. She regularly declines offers to open franchises—she recently rejected a request from Dubai—and to star in reality-TV shows.

Clutching a cane, Jeffries made her way into Prince’s, where a few employees had started cleaning up. Spotting a brick near the front door, she shrieked, “Is that the brick that was on the accelerator?” Her event planner, Katrina Ware, laughed and said, “Naw, that brick’s in evidence now.” Jeffries said, “Have mercy!” Her tinkly voice is laced with cackle and rasp.

People eat at Prince’s because of the chicken but also because of the story behind it. Jeffries has spent the better part of her adulthood recounting the legend, for she inherited both the recipe (which is secret) and the family lore (which is unverifiable). In the nineteen-thirties, her great-uncle Thornton Prince III was a handsome pig farmer and fond of women. One Saturday night, he dragged home late, angering his girlfriend. The next day, Prince asked her to make his favorite food, fried chicken. The girlfriend complied, but with a furious twist: she saturated the bird in cayenne pepper and other spices.

No doubt, Prince was expected to suffer, and did—but he also enjoyed the experience. He began replicating the spicy fried chicken and selling it on weekends, out of his home. He eventually opened a small restaurant, the BBQ Chicken Shack, which became beloved in the black community. It became popular with white people, too, especially after the restaurant moved to a location near the Grand Ole Opry. Under Jim Crow, the Princes were not free to dine wherever and however they wanted, or to use the front door of white establishments, but they never told their own customers where to sit or what door to use. The matter handled itself: black patrons sat up front; whites entered through the back door and sat in back.

Nashville, which was chartered in 1806, on the Cumberland River, is closer to Bowling Green, Kentucky—Union territory—than to Memphis. By the start of the Civil War, it was one of the country’s sixty largest cities, with a population of seventeen thousand. The Union Army saw Nashville as a potential supply center, and captured the city in 1862. Escaped slaves flocked there, adding to an already sizable African-American population. The Prince family had been enslaved at a plantation south of town. Thornton Prince III seems to have been born around 1893.

The civil-rights leader Ralph Abernathy once said that, in the black community of the nineteen-thirties, “chicken was the best of all meals to serve,” especially on Sundays: “Gospel bird” was “better than ham, better than pork chops, better even than roast beef or steak.” Timothy Charles Davis, in his cookbook, points out that poor people don’t tend to document their lives the way well-off people do, and that American journalists of the early twentieth century covered only “high-end, white-tablecloth places, not workingman joints peopled by African-Americans.” The name of the girlfriend whose attempt at revenge inspired a culinary phenomenon is unknown. The story is “so perfect, it almost—almost—seems created out of whole cloth,” Davis noted, but he added, “Does the lobster roll have such a story? I think not.” The chef and TV personality Carla Hall, a Nashville native who made hot chicken the main attraction at her former restaurant in Brooklyn, has said that, whatever the details about Thornton Prince III’s love life, “the chicken ain’t nothing but the truth.”

After Prince died, around 1960, the restaurant got passed around to relatives, eventually landing with Jeffries, the granddaughter of one of his brothers. She made some tweaks. First, she changed the name to Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack. “Hot chicken is not barbecue! ” she told me. She replaced the restaurant’s nineteen-inch cast-iron skillets with deep-frying vats. Then, after a mother asked her why Prince’s didn’t serve chicken that wouldn’t terrify her children, Jeffries introduced varying levels of spiciness. The current maximum level, XXXHot, is irresistible to spice-hounds and fools. The menu board, hanging above the order window, features an image of flames.

YouTube is filled with footage of people trying hot chicken. Rendered speechless, they cough, tear up, towel off. The best way to eat fried chicken is with your hands, but Nashville hot chicken leaves the fingertips glistening with red residue. Jeffries still talks about the customer who made the mistake of wiping his eyes with his fingers—he knocked over furniture in his agonized rush to reach the bathroom faucet.

Jeffries enjoys pointing out that men tend to order the hottest varieties to see if they can stand them, whereas women order their chicken that way because they like the heat. Hot chicken’s unofficial ambassador, the former mayor Bill Purcell, likes to say that, at Prince’s, anything hotter than Hot “ain’t chattin’ food.” When the English food writer Tom Parker Bowles, the son of Camilla, ate at Prince’s, in 2004, he ignored a recommendation to start with Mild or Hot and instead ordered XHot, telling himself, “This will show these lily-tongued Southerners what true British grit is really about.” He was soon silently berating himself as a “vainglorious twat.”

In 2013, Sean Brock, then a celebrated chef in Charleston, showed up at Prince’s with a pal. Jeffries took their order. “Am I crazy if I get the extra-hot?” Brock asked.

“That’s suicidal chicken,” Jeffries told him.

“I gotta do it,” Brock said. “But I’m nervous.”

The friend asked him, “What’s the worst that could happen?”

Jeffries said, “Just don’t let it happen in here.”

Prince’s is so secretive about its recipe that employees must agree in writing not to divulge details. Cameras aren’t allowed in the kitchen, which is mostly walled off from customers’ view. Devotees are left to guess at the ingredients: paprika, garlic, onion powder, vinegar, pickle juice, pork fat, bacon grease, sugar? Perhaps the chicken is marinated in spiced milk, dredged in spiced flour, fried in spiced cooking oil, and then coated in a spicy paste. (“Milk?” Jeffries told me. “No, no, no!”) On Reddit, someone theorized that, during the preparation of hot chicken, “the oil combines with the chili to make some kind of undigestible lava.” Semone Jeffries, André’s daughter, who is in her early fifties and runs Prince’s with her mom, can be seen in the background of one video, ladling out a rich, auburn liquid; but, she has hinted, the secret isn’t “just dousing some spicy stuff on top at the last minute.” A customer once described Prince’s hot chicken as spice “down to the bone.”


“I’m downstairs.”
A food’s spiciness can be measured in Scoville Heat Units, a gauge developed, in the early twentieth century, by Wilbur Scoville, a pharmaceuticals chemist from Connecticut. A jalapeño, at its hottest, measures 8,000 S.H.U. Cayenne, the only confirmed hot-chicken ingredient, is at least four times hotter than that. There is a growing market for peppers that have been cultivated expressly for pungency. At last check, the hottest chili pepper, as recorded in August, 2017, by Guinness World Records, was the Carolina Reaper, which comes in at 1.64 million S.H.U. Prince’s fundamental recipe predates newfangled peppers.

Cayenne stimulates the nervous system, awakens mucus, and can cause the heart to beat faster. The heat builds on itself. Jeffries likes to say that hot chicken will sober you up and clean you out. She calls it “a twenty-four-hour chicken.” Activities that may not pair well with Nashville hot chicken include a road trip, a long flight, a first date, work, sleep, and your wedding. First-timers have been advised to prepare for hot chicken by putting a roll of toilet paper in the freezer at home.

As Brock, the chef, started to eat, he took off his eyeglasses. Jeffries told him, “Start out slow.” She added, “Say your prayers.”

Brock soon said, “This has ruined fried chicken for me.”

“This is not a boring chicken,” Jeffries agreed. “It’s a passionate food.”

His face flushed, his nose running, Brock said, “I think I’m hallucinating.”

At one point during the global spread of Nashville hot chicken, someone bad-mouthed the dish as a “stunt food.” Andrew Zimmern, the host of the Travel Channel show “Bizarre Foods,” disagrees. He first tasted hot chicken forty years ago, at Prince’s. “This is not gimmick fare,” he said. “This is not a scorpion you get inside a lollipop at the museum gift shop. This is a way of eating.”

Decades ago, a former cook at Prince’s left and started his own place, Columbo’s, in downtown Nashville. In the nineties, Bill Purcell, who at that time worked as a lawyer, represented the restaurant in a tax matter. After trying its hot chicken, he ate at Columbo’s at least once a week. When Columbo’s closed, amid downtown redevelopment, Purcell shifted his allegiance to Prince’s, even though it was a twenty-minute drive to northeast Nashville.
