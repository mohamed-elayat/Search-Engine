## About

One of the projects for our OOP class. The program takes as input the name of a text file or of a directory of text files.
The program can then do the following:

Display:
 - For each file, all the words in it and their frequency. (In alphabetical order)
 - For each distinct word, its frequency in each of the files.   (Each distinct word in the combined list words from all the files)
 (In alphabetical and descending order)
 
Search:

 - Given a word, the program will list the files that contain it. (In descending order)



## Running the program

There's 2 ways to run the program: using the command line/terminal or using an IDE. We recommend using an IDE.

### IDE method:

Do the following:

1. Create new project
2. Open windows explorer 
3. Go into the location of your newly created project. 
	(The path can be found on the title bar of the window)
4. Delete the src folder  

5. Download the archive from GitHub  
6. Copy the src folder from the archive and paste it in the project location (to replace the src folder you deleted)  

From the IDE,  

7. Compile and run the program
